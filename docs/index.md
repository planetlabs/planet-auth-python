# Planet Auth

## Overview

Planet auth utility code.

The code in this library is general auth utility code, and does not make
any assumptions about the environment in which it is operating.  The
[Planet SDK for Python](https://developers.planet.com/docs/pythonclient/)
leverages this library, and is pre-configured for the Planet Cloud Service used
by customers.
